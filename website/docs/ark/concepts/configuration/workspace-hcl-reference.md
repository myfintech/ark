title: WORKSPACE.hcl File Reference
sidebar_label: WORKSPACE.hcl File
---

The WORKSPACE.hcl file defines the root workspace of a project and provides options to configure that workspace. A WORKSPACE.hcl file is required when Ark walks the file system. If no WORKSPACE.hcl file is found, Ark will throw an error. 

#### Example WORKSPACE.hcl file

```hcl
kubernetes {
  safe_contexts = [
    "docker-desktop"
  ]
}
vault {
  address = "http://vault.example.com"
}


file_system {
  ignore = [
    "**/node_modules/**"
  ]
}

artifacts {
  storage_base_url = "gs://ark-cache"
}

jsonnet {
  library = [
    "src/jsonnet"
  ]
}

disable_version_check = false

```

## Attribute Reference

All HCL blocks are optional in the WORKSPACE.hcl file.
Attributes marked as required are only required if their parent HCL block is defined.

### Inputs

| HCL Block | Attribute | Required | Type | Explanation |
| --------- | --------- | :------: | ---- | ----------- |
| `kubernetes` | `safe_contexts` | :heavy_check_mark: | `array of strings` | Defines a set of Kubernetes contexts that are marked as safe to deploy to. If an attempt is made to deploy a Kubernetes object to a context that is not marked as safe, that deployment will fail with an error. |
| `vault` | `address` | :heavy_check_mark: | `string` | Allows a user to set a Vault address that does not rely on an environment variable. |
| `artifacts` | `storage_base_url` | :heavy_check_mark: | `string` | Defines the location where artifacts generated by Ark will be stored. |
| `file_system` | `ignore` | :heavy_check_mark: | `array of strings` | Defines a list of files to be ignored by the file system observer. |
| `jsonnet` | `library` | | `string` | Allows a user to set a path to a specific JSonnet library to use. |
| | `disable_version_check` | | `bool` | Disables Ark from checking for updates when an `ark` command is invoked. |
